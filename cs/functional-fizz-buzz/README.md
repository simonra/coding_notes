Attempt at making the "optimal" implementation of FizzBuzz checking each condition only once as outlined in "FizzBuzz in Haskell by Embeddinga Domain-Specific Language" by Maciej Pir√≥g (2014) in C#, after seeing it referenced in a talk by Kevlin Henney.

Mostly useless, but a fun exercise in understanding functions and grappling with local functions, lambdas, and function delegates in C#.
